  <td>Hallucinations in Large Language Models: When More Data Reinforces Error and Minimal Perturbations Reveal Misclassification</td>
  <td>AI Reliability / Error Diagnosis</td>
  <td>Most "hallucinations" in AI are not real fabrications — they are fixable mistakes from unclear prompts. A simple one-line change often corrects them. Only a small stubborn remainder are true hallucinations. The paper shows how to separate the two — essential when being wrong carries high cost or risk.</td>

  <td>Why does adding more GPUs eventually make training slower? This paper introduces the Information Density Limit (IDL) — a physical ceiling where dense clusters stop acting like independent lanes and become one shared noisy channel, forcing throughput to drop and returns to turn negative.</td>
