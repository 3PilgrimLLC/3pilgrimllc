  <td>Hallucinations in Large Language Models: When More Data Reinforces Error and Minimal Perturbations Reveal Misclassification</td>
  <td>AI Cognition / Diagnostic Primitives</td>
  <td>This paper forks the catchall term “hallucination” into resolvable trajectory errors (underspecification, corpus skew, compression loss) and a narrow irreducible class (true hallucinations). A zero-cost perturbation protocol (sense binding, variable binding, contract restatement) demonstrates that most low-accuracy outputs flip to high accuracy under minimal clarification. A conservative gate and orthogonal severity matrix enable triage by materiality and risk; Sense-Binding Rate (SBR) quantifies resolvable error surface. Reclassification shows current frameworks improve comprehension but leave the true-hallucination tail untouched — a prerequisite for reliable deployment in zero-tolerance domains.</td>

  <td>The Information Density Limit: When Parallel Computers Become a Communication Medium</td>
  <td>AI Infrastructure / Compute Scaling</td>
  <td>This paper introduces the Information Density Limit (IDL) as a derivative seventh boundary to the Compute-Efficiency Frontier (CEF). The model predicts a hard physical ceiling on data-center hardware density: beyond the IDL crossover, adding accelerators yields negative marginal returns on training time and energy per gradient.</td>

  <td>The Economics of AI: Sailing the Insolvent Seas</td>
  <td>AI Economics / Compute Infrastructure</td>
  <td>This paper dissects the structural disequilibrium in AI economics. It models the sector as two incompatible regimes: capital-intensive, high-utilization training (hyperscale clusters, burst-driven, long depreciation) versus low-margin, chronically low-utilization inference (5–15% sustained, intermittent demand, thin per-query revenues). Vertical integration creates reflexive negative-return scaling, idle capital turned to heat via energy/cooling irreversibility, and FOMO-fueled oversupply. Proposes bifurcation as equilibrium: training as utility-like compute providers; inference as competitive service layer. Analogizes to semiconductor fabless-foundry split.</td>

  <td>Hallucinated Agents: A Cognitive Mechanism for Resolving Ambiguous Threats</td>
  <td>Evolution / Cognition</td>
  <td>Proposes that agent hallucinations (e.g., ghosts, monsters) under ambiguous threat are not glitches but an evolved reflexive circuit-breaker: the Minimal Viable Agent (MVA) inserts a fictional adversary to re-anchor cognition to familiar threat vectors, halting neurochemical escalation and bounded-time freeze in high-arousal ambiguity. Extends to internal threats via Internal Minimal Viable Cause (IMVC) for panic resolution. Unifies freeze dynamics, HADD, error management theory, predictive processing, catastrophic interoception, and intolerance of uncertainty under a dual-threshold stop-rule controller.</td>

  <td>Friction-Guided Optimization: Negative Tomography in Overparameterized Learning</td>
  <td>AI Research</td>
  <td>Introduces three minimal primitives—gradient erosion carving negative space, Fisher metric as parametric friction field ϕ(θ; u) = uᵀ F(θ) u, and overparameterization as degeneracy amplifier—to unify flat minima, low intrinsic dimension, low-rank Fisher spectra, fractal roughness, hyperbolic curvature, and grokking-like phase transitions in overparameterized learning. Reframes training as erosive negative tomography with apparent gravity emerging post-erosion from friction anisotropy; derives a three-phase friction-guided protocol with state-dependent triggers</td>

  <td>Introduces Negative Tomography, a domain-agnostic inference framework treating structural failure modes as first-class primitives. Rejects positive-first generation in sparse or unbounded spaces; instead exhaustively characterizes forbiddances to define a dual space whose complement reconstructs the latent invariant or manifold. Formalizes absence as primary information carrier, symmetry as fixed point under exhaustive negative satisfaction, and five design invariants (failure-first ordering, non-pegging, anchor acquisition, recursive inversion, selective constraint relaxation).</td>
