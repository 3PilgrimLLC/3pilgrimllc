  <td>Hallucinated Agents: A Cognitive Mechanism for Resolving Ambiguous Threats</td>
  <td>Evolution / Cognition</td>
  <td>Proposes that agent hallucinations (e.g., ghosts, monsters) under ambiguous threat are not glitches but an evolved reflexive circuit-breaker: the Minimal Viable Agent (MVA) inserts a fictional adversary to re-anchor cognition to familiar threat vectors, halting neurochemical escalation and bounded-time freeze in high-arousal ambiguity. Extends to internal threats via Internal Minimal Viable Cause (IMVC) for panic resolution. Unifies freeze dynamics, HADD, error management theory, predictive processing, catastrophic interoception, and intolerance of uncertainty under a dual-threshold stop-rule controller.</td>

  <td>Friction-Guided Optimization: Negative Tomography in Overparameterized Learning</td>
  <td>AI Research</td>
  <td>Introduces three minimal primitives—gradient erosion carving negative space, Fisher metric as parametric friction field ϕ(θ; u) = uᵀ F(θ) u, and overparameterization as degeneracy amplifier—to unify flat minima, low intrinsic dimension, low-rank Fisher spectra, fractal roughness, hyperbolic curvature, and grokking-like phase transitions in overparameterized learning. Reframes training as erosive negative tomography with apparent gravity emerging post-erosion from friction anisotropy; derives a three-phase friction-guided protocol with state-dependent triggers</td>

  <td>Negative Tomography: Structural Inference via Failure‑First Primitives</td>
  <td>AI Research</td>
  <td>Introduces Negative Tomography, a domain-agnostic inference framework treating structural failure modes as first-class primitives. Rejects positive-first generation in sparse or unbounded spaces; instead exhaustively characterizes forbiddances to define a dual space whose complement reconstructs the latent invariant or manifold. Formalizes absence as primary information carrier, symmetry as fixed point under exhaustive negative satisfaction, and five design invariants (failure-first ordering, non-pegging, anchor acquisition, recursive inversion, selective constraint relaxation).</td>

  <td>A Geometric Theory of Cognition</td>
  <td>Evolution / Cognition</td>
  <td>A general, reductionist theory of evolution formalizing behavior and cognition as navigation over a constrained geometric state space shaped by genetic survivorship, environmental friction, and reinforcement dynamics. Introduces reproduction as the temporal primitive of genomic time, ego* as a locally optimizing behavioral process, and population-level bias as an emergent structural property. Non-teleological; descriptive only; no normative or predictive claims.</td>

  <td>Introduces rate of sovereign debt duration compression (κ) as a structural primitive for fiat instability. Formalizes temporal lattice dynamics and stability decay via dS/dt = -S · κ, with TSR = WAM / σ_t as diagnostic. Empirical correlations from U.S. Treasury data (1950–2025) show ~70-month inflection linked to volatility spikes. Reductionist hypothesis; no predictive claims.</td>

  <td>A minimal structural lattice of three primitives explaining systematic miscalibration and risk accumulation in persistent digital environments. The reductionist framework rejects psychological or adversarial explanations and attributes failure to architectural mismatch between human cognition and infrastructure enforcing temporal agnosticism, perfect persistence, and context-stripped invariance.</td>
