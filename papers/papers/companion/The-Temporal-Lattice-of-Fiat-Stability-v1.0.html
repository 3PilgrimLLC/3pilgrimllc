	<hr />

      <p><strong>1) Why This Paper Exists</strong></p>
      <p>The first paper (<em>A Quantitative Model for Pricing
      Gold</em>) reframed gold as a <em>measurement device</em>: not a
      policy tool or investment thesis, but a stable external reference
      that reveals when fiat units drift.</p>
      <p>The second paper (<em>The Half Life of Fiat: A Statistical
      History of Monetary Decay</em>) showed that once convertibility is
      removed, fiat systems exhibit a characteristic <em>temporal
      decay</em>—a generational half-life on the order of decades. Drift
      is not random; it accumulates on a recognizable timescale.</p>
      <p><strong>That left a missing question:</strong></p>
      <p>If gold measures drift, and fiat systems decay on a
      generational clock, what actually stabilizes a fiat unit
      day-to-day in the absence of an external anchor?</p>
      <p>This paper answers that question by identifying the internal
      mechanism that substitutes for convertibility: the time structure
      of sovereign obligations.</p>
      <p>In an unanchored regime, demand for the currency is sustained
      not by redemption, but by contractual necessity spread across
      time. Taxes, coupons, principal rollovers, collateral
      requirements, and refinancing schedules create durable,
      predictable demand for the unit—<em>but only if those obligations
      are sufficiently distributed through the future</em>.</p>
      <p>This paper argues that the maturity structure of sovereign
      debt, especially its weighted average maturity (WAM) and the
      <em>rate at which that maturity compresses</em>, functions as a
      first-order stabilizer of fiat systems.</p>
      <p>When that temporal lattice compresses—when obligations are
      pulled toward the present—rollover frequency rises, planning
      horizons shorten, and volatility increases, even if headline
      aggregates appear stable.</p>
      <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Duration is the stabilizer.<br />
      Treat the sovereign debt stack as a <em>temporal lattice</em> of
      obligations. Its first moment is weighted average maturity (WAM).
      Stability is not primarily a function of how much debt exists, but
      <em>how far into the future demand for the currency is
      contractually scheduled</em>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Speed matters more than level.<br />
      The key signal is not low WAM per se, but the <em>rate at which
      duration shortens</em>. The paper defines a compression
      rate</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="math display">\[\kappa = \frac{d\left(
      \frac{1}{WAM} \right)}{dt}\]</span></p>
      <p>Rising κ means obligations are being pulled forward faster,
      increasing rollover frequency and making the system more sensitive
      to shocks.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Stability decays non-linearly under compression.<br />
      The paper formalizes this intuition with a simple temporal
      elasticity relation:</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dS}{dt} = - S \cdot \kappa\
      \ \]</span></p>
      <p>where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> denotes price
      stability (approximately the inverse of volatility). Positive κ
      implies exponential decay in stability—not because fundamentals
      worsen, but because <em>time itself is being compressed</em>.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>An empirical inflection zone appears in U.S. data.<br />
      Historically, when U.S. WAM falls below roughly 70 months,
      volatility amplification becomes more pronounced; above it,
      dynamics are more damped. This is not a universal threshold—just
      an observed regime transition that flags rising
      fragility.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>To operationalize this, the paper proposes a Temporal Solvency
      Ratio:</p>
      <p><span class="math inline">\(TSR = \frac{WAM}{\sigma
      t}\)</span>​</p>
      <p>with instability rising as TSR approaches ~10.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Stress appears before CPI does.<br />
      Duration compression shortens forecasting horizons and raises
      rollover risk. This widens risk premia and compresses valuation
      multiples <em>before</em> inflation necessarily registers the
      stress. Volatility is the early warning channel.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>3) What Distinguishes This Framework</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Time, not levels, is the primitive.<br />
      Most macro frameworks emphasize stock variables (debt/GDP,
      deficits, money supply) or credibility narratives. This paper
      elevates <em>time distribution</em>—how obligations are spaced
      across the future—as the primary stabilizer in unanchored fiat
      systems.</p></li>
      <li><p>A single structural signal replaces many noisy
      indicators.<br />
      Rather than juggling multiple aggregates, the compression rate κ
      is advanced as a compact diagnostic that explains why instability
      can rise even when traditional “fundamentals” look
      unchanged.</p></li>
      <li><p>It completes the trilogy.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Paper 1: gold as an external <em>measurement
      lens</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Paper 2: fiat decay as a <em>temporal base
      rate</em></p></li>
      <li><p>This paper: sovereign duration as the <em>internal
      stabilizer</em></p></li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, they describe <em>how drift is measured, how fast it
      accumulates, and what slows or accelerates it in
      practice</em>.</p>
      <p>4) Theoretical Implications</p>
      <p><em>(If the Framework Is Correct)</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Sovereign duration acts as a synthetic anchor.<br />
      In fiat regimes, long-dated obligations function like a tether,
      distributing currency demand across time and damping reflexive
      feedback loops. Shortening maturities weakens that
      tether.</p></li>
      <li><p>The velocity of compression dominates quantity.<br />
      κ operationalizes a form of temporal entropy: as obligations
      collapse into the near term faster than markets can price and roll
      them, instability accelerates non-linearly—even if debt/GDP or
      money aggregates are flat.</p></li>
      <li><p>Regime thresholds are context-specific but real.<br />
      The ~70-month U.S. inflection is not a constant of nature. Each
      sovereign appears to have a TSR region where dynamics flip from
      damped to reflexive, depending on institutional depth, market
      structure, and credibility history.</p></li>
      <li><p>The half-life lens becomes mechanistic.<br />
      The generational decay documented in Paper 2 is no longer
      mysterious. Persistent duration compression moves the system
      faster along its half-life curve; extending duration
      <em>re-stretches time</em> and slows decay.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>5) Scope and Intent (Clarified)</p>
      <p>This paper:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>does not argue that duration alone guarantees
      stability</p></li>
      <li><p>does not replace fiscal or monetary analysis</p></li>
      <li><p>does not claim universality of specific thresholds</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>It identifies temporal structure as an underappreciated but
      first-order variable in fiat stability—one that explains why
      stress often appears suddenly, why volatility leads inflation, and
      why systems can look healthy right up until they aren’t.</p>
