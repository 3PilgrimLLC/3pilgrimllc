  <p><strong>1) Why This Paper Exists</strong></p>
  <p>We set out to answer a simple but rarely formalized question:<br />
  What makes a relationship between people <em>structurally
  stable</em>—and can that be modeled?</p>
  <p>Most relationship frameworks focus on feelings, communication
  styles, or personality labels. Those tools can be useful, but they
  struggle in high-stakes domains: marriage, co-founding, shared
  finances, and children. In those settings, decisions are irreversible,
  constraints are real, and failure has long-term costs.</p>
  <p>Our goal was to treat these relationships as systems. That means
  thinking in terms of constraints, operating modes, design choices, and
  predictable failure patterns—much like engineering problems. The aim
  is not to replace emotion, but to define a small set of structural
  primitives that researchers, clinicians, or AI systems can build
  on.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language
  Summary)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Two thinking modes, one critical switch.</strong><br />
  Humans operate in two broad modes. <em>Emotional Reasoning Mode
  (ERM)</em> governs bonding, empathy, and social harmony. <em>Logical
  Reasoning Mode (LRM)</em> governs tradeoffs, constraints, and
  irreversible decisions.</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>Many relationships fail because ERM is used to make LRM-level
  commitments—contracts, finances, children, legal bonds. Choosing a
  shared future using the wrong “operating system” is the most common
  and predictable failure mode.</p>
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Compatibility means alignment under
  constraints.</strong><br />
  Each person has non-negotiables (fixed constraints) and flexible
  preferences (elastic constraints). Together, these define the topology
  of a person’s life.<br />
  For a relationship to be stable, rigidity must not collide. If both
  partners are rigid and opposed on the same axis (children, religion,
  spending philosophy), there is no viable shared future on that
  dimension—no matter how strong the feelings are.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Behavior under pressure matters more than
  personality.</strong><br />
  We introduce PLR: <em>Parsimony</em>, <em>Leverage orientation</em>,
  and <em>Risk posture</em>. These are continuous gradients, not labels,
  that describe how people decide under scarcity, conflict, and
  uncertainty.<br />
  Stability improves when PLR profiles are close or flexible. Volatility
  rises when they diverge sharply—especially when both partners are
  rigid.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Masking is normal; stress testing reveals
  reality.</strong><br />
  Early relationships involve masking: optimism, signaling, and conflict
  avoidance. This is expected. The paper argues for intentional stress
  tests—budgeting together, difficult travel, small joint projects—to
  expose real decision patterns before commitments lock in.<br />
  The emphasis is on clear constraint disclosure and denotative clarity,
  not emotional performance.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>The Two Outcome Rule.</strong><br />
  In high-stakes decisions, every conflict ends in one of two
  ways:<br />
  either both parties converge on a shared logical model, or the future
  diverges.<br />
  “Agreeing to disagree” is not stable when the stakes are
  structural.</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>3) What Distinguishes This Framework From Existing
  Approaches</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Mode selection is the root cause.</strong><br />
  Instead of treating failure as a communication or personality problem,
  the model identifies a deeper issue: using emotional reasoning where
  logical reasoning is required. Many so-called communication failures
  are actually operating-mode mismatches.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Constraints are geometric, not motivational.</strong><br />
  The framework draws a hard line between preferences and
  non-negotiables. Incompatibility is treated as a geometry problem—the
  intersection of constraint sets—not as something that effort, love, or
  therapy can always resolve.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>PLR is minimal and continuous.</strong><br />
  Rather than sorting people into types, PLR captures tendencies along
  three gradients. This allows reasoning about distance, elasticity, and
  stress response in a compact space that can be measured, modeled, and
  extended.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>From bargaining to design.</strong><br />
  Partnership formation is framed as designing a single, viable life
  system—not negotiating wins and losses. Emotional leverage is
  structurally harmful because it obscures constraints and blocks
  genuine convergence.</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>4) Theoretical Implications (Assuming the Work Is
  Correct)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Correct mode use is required for stability.</strong><br />
  High-stakes relationships involve irreversible merges. That makes them
  structural domains where LRM must dominate commitment decisions. ERM
  remains essential for bonding, but becomes dangerous when used for
  contracts.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Constraint geometry predicts feasibility.</strong><br />
  Compatibility reduces to whether constraint sets intersect and whether
  there is enough behavioral elasticity to sustain a joint path over
  time. When rigid constraints collide, no stable solution exists on
  that axis.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Behavioral gradients enable forecasting.</strong><br />
  PLR position and flexibility under stress provide low-dimensional
  inputs for anticipating conflict patterns, financial outcomes, and
  negotiation dynamics—without assuming fixed personality traits.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>The Two Outcome Rule as a stability test.</strong><br />
  If high-stakes conflicts repeatedly fail to reach shared logical
  models, divergence is already underway. Persistent emotional
  negotiation in structural domains is a falsifiable predictor of
  instability.</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>5) Potential Implications (Downstream, Not
  Predictions)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Clinical and counseling practice.</strong><br />
  Intake and premarital or partnership work could include constraint
  mapping, PLR estimation, and structured stress tests to surface masked
  incompatibilities early.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Legal and financial advising.</strong><br />
  Advisers can apply LRM-first checklists to co-founding agreements,
  prenups, mortgages, and joint investments, identifying dual rigidity
  and risk mismatches before commitments are made.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>AI and HR systems.</strong><br />
  The primitives support compatibility modeling, team assembly, and
  conflict forecasting using PLR embeddings, mode detection, and
  constraint intersection logic.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Public education.</strong><br />
  Shifting from “communicate better” to “switch modes, map constraints,
  and test under load” could materially reduce catastrophic relationship
  failures by addressing structure before emotion.</p>
  </div></li>
