      <p><strong>Why This Paper Exists</strong></p>
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>AI companies and investors have poured hundreds of billions
      into building ever-larger compute clusters under the assumption
      that bigger = better and that the economics will eventually sort
      themselves out.</p>
      <p>This paper starts from a different premise: the current
      business model is structurally broken, not just temporarily
      expensive.</p>
      <p>The central idea is straightforward: training and inference are
      not two phases of one business—they are two fundamentally
      different economic regimes that cannot healthily coexist on the
      same balance sheet. Forcing them together creates a persistent
      disequilibrium that gets worse with scale, not better. The goal is
      to make that structural mismatch visible and to show why the only
      stable long-term outcome is separation (bifurcation), not more
      vertical integration.</p>
      <hr />

      <li><p><strong>What the Paper Says (Plain Language
      Summary)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>Two incompatible worlds inside AI</em></p>
      </div></li>
      </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Training is heavy industry: infrequent, massively
      capital-intensive projects that need hyperscale clusters running
      at high utilization for weeks or months. Inference is consumer
      services: continuous but bursty demand, low margins per query, and
      hardware that sits mostly idle (typically 5–15% sustained
      utilization in real deployments).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>The trap when they share one company<br />
      </em>Training builds giant, expensive infrastructure optimized for
      peak bursts. Inference inherits all that fixed cost but rarely
      uses more than a small fraction of it. The unused GPUs,
      networking, and cooling still draw near-full power and depreciate
      anyway. Result: huge sunk costs drag down inference profitability,
      marginal returns turn negative as clusters get bigger, and the
      whole system keeps scaling because narrative and capital inflows
      outrun the reality of the math.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>Physics makes it hard to escape<br />
      </em>Datacenters are built for constant, stable power and
      cooling—not for elastic on/off switching. You can’t cheaply idle
      80–90% of a multi-gigawatt site without wasting most of the energy
      bill. This irreversibility turns low utilization into a structural
      tax that software tricks and batching can only partially
      offset.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>Bifurcation is the way out<br />
      </em>Long-term equilibrium comes from splitting the regimes:</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><p>Training becomes a utility business selling raw compute
      capacity to anyone (like a foundry).</p></li>
      <li><p>Inference becomes a competitive service layer buying that
      capacity as an operating expense and focusing on delivering fast,
      cheap, reliable queries to end users.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This mirrors what happened in semiconductors: integrated chip
      makers eventually gave way to fabless designers + dedicated
      foundries because the two activities have incompatible
      economics.</p>

      <li><p><strong>What Distinguishes This Framework From Most
      Commentary</strong></p></li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>The problem as regime mismatch, not bad
      execution</em><br />
      Most writing blames high capex, poor management, or waiting for
      the next hardware jump. Our argument is that the core issue is
      orthogonal cost structures and utilization asymmetry—problems no
      amount of optimization inside a single company can fully fix.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>Reflexivity is the mechanism keeping the disequilibrium
      alive<br />
      </em></p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Scale → higher valuation → more capital → bigger clusters →
      bigger narrative → more capital.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>The loop is self-reinforcing until physical limits (power
      grids, cooling, depreciation math) or financial limits (investor
      patience) force a change.</p>
      </div>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><em>It starts with physics and infrastructure floors<br />
      </em>Energy draw doesn’t scale down linearly with load. Cooling
      and power systems run near steady-state. These are hard
      constraints that bound what business models and software can
      achieve—most analyses start with dollars or tokens instead.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>We are intentionally avoiding timelines, company names in
      forecasts, or “who wins” speculation.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>The purpose of this document is simple: to supply conceptual
      primitives (regime orthogonality, utilization asymmetry, energy
      irreversibility, reflexive oversupply) so readers can watch events
      unfold against that map.</p>
