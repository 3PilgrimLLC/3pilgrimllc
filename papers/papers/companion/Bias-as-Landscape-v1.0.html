	<hr />
      <p><strong>Preface: What This Paper Is Really About</strong></p>
      <p>This paper is built around a simple idea that often sounds
      strange at first, but becomes obvious once you sit with it:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Evolution “thinks.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It just thinks on a timescale we’re not used to.</p>
      <p>Human thinking happens moment to moment. Evolutionary thinking
      happens across generations. The two are related, but they are not
      the same process, and they do not run on the same clock.</p>
      <p>Evolution doesn’t reason, plan, or intend. Instead, it operates
      as a slow, step-by-step filter. The clock only advances when a new
      child is conceived. Each birth is a single “tick” of evolutionary
      time. Between those ticks, nothing about the genetic system
      updates.</p>
      <p>From this perspective, humans are not the thinkers in
      evolution—we are the <em>experiments</em>. Each person is a trial
      run of a genetic configuration (like a toy model) interacting with
      an environment. Most of what happens inside a lifetime never feeds
      back into evolution at all. Only what survives long enough to
      reproduce gets recorded.</p>
      <p><em>This creates a fundamental asymmetry in agency.</em></p>
      <p>As individuals, we experience choice, effort, and intention.
      But we do not start from a blank slate. Our bodies, instincts,
      stress responses, appetites, and many of our behavioral tendencies
      are the result of optimization processes that finished long before
      we were born, often long before our species existed. We can resist
      these behavioral tendencies, redirect them, or work around
      them—but never without cost.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean humans have no agency. It means agency exists
      inside sometimes quantifiable constraints. What this paper does is
      show how those constraints arise from the interaction of three
      systems:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li><p>Genetics, which encode slow, accumulated solutions
      discovered across generations.</p></li>
      <li><p>Individual cognition, which navigates those inherited
      structures within a single lifetime.</p></li>
      <li><p>Environment, which shapes how costly or easy different
      behaviors are at any given moment.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>When these systems interact, behavior doesn’t look like free
      choice from an unlimited menu. It looks like movement across a
      landscape—some paths are easy, some are hard, and some are
      effectively unreachable.</p>
      <p>Once you see behavior this way, several things stop being
      mysterious:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Why effort feels real and uneven</p></li>
      <li><p>Why some changes “stick” and others snap back</p></li>
      <li><p>Why stress reveals patterns people didn’t know they
      had</p></li>
      <li><p>Why populations show consistent biases without anyone
      coordinating them</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most importantly, this perspective creates an opening for
      mathematical modeling. If behavior is structured movement rather
      than pure spontaneity, then patterns, distributions, and
      trajectories can be described without moral judgment, diagnosis,
      or storytelling.</p>
      <p>That is what this paper attempts to do.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>It does not tell people how they <em>should</em> behave.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>It does not claim humans are machines.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>It does not deny experience, emotion, or meaning.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <p>It simply shows how evolution performs a form of slow
      inference, how humans operate as fast local optimizers within that
      inherited structure, and how the interaction between the two
      creates behavior that is predictable in aggregate—even while
      remaining personal and lived at the individual level.</p>
      <p>The sections that follow build the formal model.</p>
      <p>This preface exists only to explain why such a model is
      possible at all.</p>
      <p><strong>Bias as Landscape: The Geometry of Cognition and
      Evolution (v1.0) — Companion Explainer</strong></p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>1) Why This Paper Exists (and How It Links to the
      Compatibility Paper)</strong></p>
      <p>In our prior work on relationship compatibility, we treated
      stability as a structural problem: use the correct reasoning mode
      (LRM over ERM), map non-negotiable constraints, and evaluate
      behavioral gradients (PLR) under stress. That framework explained
      <em>how</em> incompatibilities appear at the relationship
      level.</p>
      <p>The natural next question was deeper:</p>
      <p><strong>Where do those constraints and gradients come from in
      the first place?</strong></p>
      <p>This paper proposes a shared underlying structure that
      generates them. It introduces a geometric substrate common to
      evolution, cognition, and behavior—so the compatibility model can
      be seen as a higher-level application of a more fundamental
      landscape.</p>
      <p>The goal is a domain-general, non-normative foundation that
      explains why behavior looks like <em>biased motion</em> rather
      than free choice, and why effort, resistance, and “friction”
      appear when people move against deep internal gradients.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language
      Summary)</strong></p>
      <p>• <strong>Behavior emerges from a layered
      landscape.</strong><br />
      The model describes three interacting layers operating on the same
      underlying surface:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li><p><strong>Genetics</strong> create deep “wells” or attractors
      shaped across generations.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Ego</strong>* is a flexible, local optimizer that
      navigates this surface within a lifetime.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Environment</strong> reshapes the surface by
      steepening or flattening gradients (scarcity tightens options;
      surplus expands them).</p></li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Bias is structural, not moral.</strong><br />
      Populations do not face neutral menus of behavior. They occupy
      biased distributions with means, variances, and attractors.
      Individuals move within those distributions. There is no unbiased
      behavior—only variation around a structured center.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Friction explains effort and cost.</strong><br />
      Moving away from genetic attractors requires effort. That effort
      is asymmetric: movement toward historically successful
      configurations is cheaper than movement away from them. Ego* can
      resist these gradients, but resistance always carries a cost.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Two timescales unify evolution and
      intelligence.</strong><br />
      Evolution operates as a slow, turn-based optimizer that reweights
      populations each generation. Ego* is a fast, continuous optimizer
      acting within a single life. Both operate on the same landscape,
      making genes the slow learner and cognition the fast learner.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Additional modulators matter, but don’t multiply
      agents.</strong><br />
      The microbiome is treated as a friction modifier, not a separate
      decision-maker. Genetic time advances only through successful
      reproduction. Environments with very low friction can produce
      degeneracy—stable local behaviors that drift away from long-run
      viability. The paper is deliberately non-diagnostic and
      non-prescriptive.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>3) What Distinguishes This Framework From Existing
      Approaches</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>One geometry for biology and mind.</strong><br />
      Rather than separating evolution, cognition, and behavior, the
      paper defines a single informational landscape where genetic
      attractors, cognitive paths, and environmental pressures
      coexist—without importing moral or semantic narratives.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Behavior as trajectories, not types.</strong><br />
      Individuals are modeled as paths sampled within biased
      distributions, not as holders of fixed traits or categories. This
      allows clustering and prediction without relying on labels.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Evolution as turn-based inference.</strong><br />
      Each generation “deploys” genetic policies; selection reweights
      the population. This reframes evolution as non-deliberative
      inference over time, linking cleanly to replicator dynamics
      without teleology.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Friction as a first-class concept.</strong><br />
      Explicitly modeling friction—and its asymmetry—explains why some
      deviations self-correct while others require continuous effort.
      This replaces vague narratives with measurable cost surfaces.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>The compatibility model sits on this
      base.</strong><br />
      PLR gradients, constraint topologies, and mode selection from the
      earlier paper become natural consequences of this deeper geometry
      rather than ad hoc constructs.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>A. A New Model of Evolution (Unified Geometry, Two
      Timescales)</strong></p>
      <p>• <strong>Turn-based genetic “cognition.”</strong><br />
      Evolution is formalized as population reweighting on a fixed
      fitness surface each generation. There is no intent—only
      selection. Over time, environmental structure is compressed into
      heritable constraints.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Explicit asymmetry in friction.</strong><br />
      Movement toward persistent configurations is cheaper than movement
      away. This predicts reversion pressure and stability basins
      without storytelling or purpose.</p>
      <p>• <strong>Two optimizers, one surface.</strong><br />
      Genes optimize slowly and discretely; ego* optimizes quickly and
      locally. Sharing a state space makes individual behavior and
      population change directly comparable.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>B. A Quantitative Substrate for Behavior (Bias →
      Trajectories → Distributions)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Bias comes before choice.</strong><br />
      Populations define biased envelopes. Individuals sample
      trajectories inside them, paying frictional costs when moving
      against strong gradients. Traits become positions; choices become
      paths.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Environment controls variance.</strong><br />
      Scarcity compresses behavior; surplus expands it. This predicts
      measurable changes in dispersion and tail behavior under different
      macro conditions.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Degeneracy under low friction.</strong><br />
      When constraints flatten, locally stable behaviors can drift away
      from long-run viability. This explains persistent misalignment
      without invoking pathology or moral failure.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Foundation for the compatibility model.</strong><br />
      PLR gradients map to directional tendencies on the surface.
      Constraint collisions appear as topologically unreachable regions.
      Relationship incompatibility becomes visible as geometry, not
      psychology.</p>
