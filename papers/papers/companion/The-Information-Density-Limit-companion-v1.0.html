      <p><strong>Why This Paper Exists</strong> (and How It Links to the
      Compute-Efficiency Frontier)</p>
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>In our prior work on the Compute-Efficiency Frontier, we
      treated scaling limits as a structural problem: map the six
      primitive walls (compute, power, heat, data movement, parallelism,
      transmission) and show where marginal returns go to zero. That
      framework explained why bigger models hit physical boundaries.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>The natural next question was deeper: Where do those early
      boundaries actually come from in dense, real-world clusters?</p>
      </div>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>This paper proposes the shared underlying mechanism that
      generates them. It introduces a geometric substrate common to
      interconnect physics, training dynamics, and infrastructure design
      — so the CEF model can be seen as a higher-level application of a
      more fundamental landscape.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>The goal is a domain-general, non-normative foundation that
      explains why scaling looks like biased motion rather than free
      acceleration, and why effort, cost, and reversal appear when we
      push against deep physical gradients.</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language
      Summary)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Scaling eventually reverses.<br />
      Beyond a critical density the interconnect stops acting like many
      independent lanes and becomes one shared, noisy channel. Effective
      bandwidth then drops in discrete steps (the famous 810 → 720 → 630
      → 540 GB/s tiers).</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>The machine becomes a congested medium.<br />
      Adding more GPUs increases shared noise (EMI, heat, vibration),
      which forces heavier error correction and retransmissions.
      Communication time grows faster than compute time, so the whole
      job slows down.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>This is physics, not software.<br />
      The paper derives the exact crossover point (D*) where <span
      class="math inline">\(\frac{dR_{eff}}{dD} \leq \ 0\)</span> and
      shows why <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT_{step}}{dD} &gt; \
      0\)</span> afterward — the mathematical proof that “more hardware
      makes training slower.”</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Training and inference must split.<br />
      Dense, deterministic fabrics are ideal for training; sparse,
      latency-predictable fabrics are ideal for inference. The split is
      not a business choice — it is a physics-driven outcome.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Engineering can delay it, but cannot remove it.<br />
      Better layout, optics, vibration isolation, and hierarchy all push
      the crossover outward — but the regime change remains.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3) What Distinguishes This Framework From Existing
      Approaches</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>One geometry for physics and systems.<br />
      Rather than treating interconnect limits as separate “walls,” the
      paper defines a single informational landscape where noise
      coupling, payload tiers, and scaling reversal coexist.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Scaling as trajectories, not types.<br />
      Clusters are modeled as paths on a cost surface, not as holders of
      fixed utilization numbers. This allows prediction of knees and
      reversal without relying on vendor benchmarks.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Evolution of the frontier, not just its shape.<br />
      The Compute-Efficiency Frontier is no longer static; IDL shows how
      density warps it inward in real time.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Friction as a first-class variable.<br />
      Explicitly modeling the closed feedback loop (Power → EMI → Heat →
      SNR drop → ECC/retrans → more power) explains why some clusters
      stay stable and others collapse under their own weight.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4) The Core Model (Unified Geometry, Two
      Timescales)</strong></p>
      <ol type="A">
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Turn-based physical “cognition.”<br />
      The interconnect fabric is formalized as a population of signal
      paths reweighted each training step. Selection (noise) reweights
      the usable bandwidth. Over time, environmental structure is
      compressed into heritable constraints on the fabric.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Explicit asymmetry in friction.<br />
      Movement toward lower-density configurations is cheaper than
      movement toward higher density. This predicts reversion pressure
      and stability basins without hand-waving.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>Two optimizers, one surface.<br />
      The training workload is a fast, continuous optimizer acting
      within a single job. The physical fabric is a slow, discrete
      optimizer acting across jobs and racks. Both operate on the same
      landscape, making cluster behavior and infrastructure design
      directly comparable.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ol>

      Complete)</strong></p>

      <p>Vendor negotiation: Ask for real measured payload tiers at
      target density, not nominal wire rates. Use the model to translate
