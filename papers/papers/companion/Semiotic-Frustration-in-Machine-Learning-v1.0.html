  <p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
  <hr /> 
  <p><strong>Why This Paper Exists, in Human Terms</strong></p>
  <p>Modern machine learning talks constantly about “high-dimensional
  spaces.”</p>
  <p>Most of the time, that phrase does not mean what it sounds
  like.</p>
  <p>In mathematics and physics, a dimension is an independent direction
  of freedom. Adding one changes the structure of a space. It creates
  new volume, new paths, and new invariants. A higher-dimensional space
  is not just a more crowded version of a lower-dimensional one—it can
  do things the lower-dimensional space fundamentally cannot.</p>
  <p>In much of machine learning, the same word is used differently.
  “High-dimensional” often means <em>many features</em>, <em>wide
  embeddings</em>, or <em>large parameter counts</em>. These additions
  increase size, but they usually do not introduce new independent
  directions. The underlying geometry stays the same. The space becomes
  denser, not broader.</p>
  <p>For a long time, this distinction did not matter. Early models were
  small, and borrowing the term “dimension” as shorthand was convenient
  and mostly harmless. As models scaled into the billions and trillions
  of parameters—and as machine learning began to intersect seriously
  with geometry, topology, and physics—the shortcut hardened into a
  category error.</p>
  <p>Today, the field routinely explains observed behaviors using
  “high-dimensional effects,” even when measurements show that effective
  dimensionality remains low. Flat minima, low-rank curvature,
  thin-shell concentration, distance collapse, and scaling plateaus are
  treated as mysterious consequences of vast dimensionality—despite
  arising precisely because true dimensional expansion has not
  occurred.</p>
  <p>This paper exists to fix that mismatch.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>It does not propose new algorithms.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>It does not dispute existing empirical findings.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>It does not claim that current models are “wrong.”</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Instead, it performs a corrective act of language.</p>
  <p>By restoring “dimension” to its invariant meaning—independent axes
  of freedom—and naming the other mechanism actually at work—vector
  aggregation within a fixed topology—the paper makes a long-standing
  paradox analytically tractable. Phenomena that appear contradictory
  under the current vocabulary become coherent once the mechanisms are
  separated.</p>
  <p>The result is not a new theory of machine learning, but a clearer
  map. A way to see which kinds of scaling increase density, which kinds
  saturate, and which kinds might plausibly create new degrees of
  freedom in the future.</p>
  <p>If the argument is correct, then many current limits are not
  optimization failures or empirical surprises. They are structural
  consequences of containment. Managing that containment can improve
  efficiency—but it cannot substitute for genuine expansion.</p>
  <p>This paper is offered as a foundation: a small set of distinctions
  meant to align language, geometry, and mechanism as machine learning
  increasingly converges with the disciplines from which its mathematics
  was borrowed.</p>
  <p><strong>Semiotic Frustration in Machine Learning
  (v1.0)</strong></p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>1) Why This Paper Exists</strong></p>
  <p>This paper exists to fix a language failure that has quietly become
  a thinking failure.</p>
  <p>In mathematics and physics, <em>dimension</em> has an invariant
  meaning: an independent axis of freedom that expands configuration
  space and enables new structural properties. In machine learning, the
  same word is routinely used to mean something else—feature count,
  embedding width, or parameter volume—even when those additions do not
  introduce independence or alter topology.</p>
  <p>For years, this semantic drift was mostly harmless. As models
  scaled and machine learning began to intersect more directly with
  geometry, topology, and physics, the mismatch hardened into a category
  error. The field now routinely explains observed behaviors—flat
  minima, low intrinsic dimension, thin-shell concentration, scaling
  plateaus—as “high-dimensional effects,” even when those behaviors
  arise precisely because true dimensional expansion has <em>not</em>
  occurred.</p>
  <p>This paper exists to resolve that paradox by repairing the
  taxonomy. It separates two mechanisms that are currently conflated
  under the single word “dimensionality,” restoring analytical clarity
  without disputing existing empirical results.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Dimension means independence.</strong><br />
  A true dimension is an independent direction of variation. Adding one
  changes the structure of a space, multiplies its volume, and enables
  new paths, separations, and invariants. More coordinates alone do not
  accomplish this.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Most ML “dimensionality” is aggregation, not
  expansion.</strong><br />
  When models grow wider or larger, they typically add
  <em>correlated</em> coordinates inside a fixed topology. This
  increases density and redundancy, not independent degrees of
  freedom.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Name the real mechanism.</strong><br />
  The paper introduces <em>vector aggregation</em> (also called vectoral
  containment) as the correct primitive for most contemporary ML growth.
  To make this precise, it defines the VNode (Vector-Node): a
  correlated, non-orthogonal vector element added without changing
  topology.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>The paradox dissolves once the mechanisms are
  separated.</strong><br />
  Low intrinsic dimension, low-rank Fisher information, flat minima,
  curvature collapse, and thin-shell sparsity are not contradictory
  “high-D effects.” They are coherent consequences of aggregation within
  a fixed space.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>The contribution is semantic, not
  algorithmic.</strong><br />
  The paper does not propose new models or benchmarks. It supplies a
  minimal, reductionist taxonomy that aligns language with geometry so
  existing observations can be interpreted correctly.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>3) What Distinguishes This Framework</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>It restores an invariant definition.<br />
  Dimensionality is treated as an independence primitive, consistent
  with mathematics and physics, rather than a proxy for size or
  count.</p></li>
  <li><p>It separates two distinct growth regimes.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><em>True Dimensional Expansion (TDE):</em> adding independent
  axes → exponential volume + new invariants</p></li>
  <li><p><em>Vector Aggregation / Containment:</em> adding correlated
  vectors → redundancy, degeneracy, low effective dimension</p></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>It unifies fragmented observations without new
  assumptions.<br />
  The framework explains why phenomena like flat minima, low-rank
  curvature, and scaling plateaus reliably co-occur—without invoking ad
  hoc explanations or new forces.</p></li>
  <li><p>It is deliberately reductionist.<br />
  Two primitives—independence and aggregation—are sufficient. The paper
  aims to clarify, not to proliferate concepts.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>4) Why This Distinction Matters</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Scaling limits become structural, not mysterious.<br />
  If additional parameters mostly increase vector aggregation, then
  diminishing returns and early plateaus are expected outcomes, not
  anomalies or optimization failures.</p></li>
  <li><p>“High-dimensional effects” are often misattributed.<br />
  Many behaviors blamed on vast dimensionality arise from containment in
  crowded, correlated spaces. The difficulty is not navigating
  exponential volume, but operating inside a dense, degenerate
  one.</p></li>
  <li><p>Interdisciplinary synthesis stops stalling.<br />
  When ML intersects with geometry or physics, shared words currently
  denote different primitives. Fixing the taxonomy removes that friction
  and enables genuine synthesis.</p></li>
  <li><p>Innovation paths become clearer.<br />
  Managing aggregation (pruning, sparsity, routing) improves efficiency
  but cannot substitute for true expansion. Genuine breakthroughs likely
  require new independent axes—temporal, causal, or modal—not further
  densification.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>5) The Core Primitive: Vector Aggregation
  (VNode)</strong></p>
  <p>To make the distinction operational, the paper introduces VNode
  (Vector-Node) as a naming anchor—not a new object, but a precise label
  for what ML has been calling “dimensions.”</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Definition (informal):<br />
  A VNode is a correlated, non-orthogonal vector element added within a
  fixed topology.</p></li>
  <li><p>Key properties:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>VNode count can grow arbitrarily while effective dimensionality
  remains low</p></li>
  <li><p>Measurable signatures include low intrinsic dimension, low-rank
  Fisher information, flat minima, and thin-shell concentration</p></li>
  <li><p>Adding VNodes increases density, not independence</p></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Contrast with TDE:<br />
  True dimensional expansion introduces new independent axes and changes
  what the space can support. VNode accumulation does not.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This naming repair allows existing literature to be reinterpreted
  cleanly: many references to “high dimensionality” are more accurately
  references to high VNode count.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>6) Implications (Interpretive, Not
  Prescriptive)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Model analysis:</strong><br />
  Evaluate effective independence (intrinsic dimension, Fisher rank)
  rather than nominal size when diagnosing capacity and
  redundancy.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Scaling expectations:</strong><br />
  Anticipate earlier saturation when growth is dominated by aggregation.
  Plateaus signal containment, not failure.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Research direction:</strong><br />
  Distinguish efforts that manage aggregation from those that plausibly
  introduce new degrees of freedom. The latter, not the former,
  correspond to true dimensional gains.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Interpretability and safety:</strong><br />
  Understanding where independence actually lives in a model improves
  reasoning about failure modes, generalization, and out-of-distribution
  behavior.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p>7<strong>) Scope and Intent (Re-Emphasized)</strong></p>
  <p>This paper:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>introduces no new algorithms</p></li>
  <li><p>disputes no empirical findings</p></li>
  <li><p>makes no performance claims</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Its purpose is to repair a category error that has accumulated as
  machine learning scaled faster than its language. By separating
  containment from expansion, it renders a long-standing paradox
  tractable and reorients discussion toward structure rather than
  size.</p>
