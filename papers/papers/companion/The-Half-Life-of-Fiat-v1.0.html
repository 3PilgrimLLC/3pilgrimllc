  <p><strong>1) Why This Paper Exists (Linked to the Gold
  Paper)</strong></p>
  <p>In our prior work, we argued that gold is better understood as a
  stable measurement reference than as a speculative asset. Large moves
  in the “price of gold” mostly reflect changes in the currency used to
  measure it—that is, fiat drift relative to a slow, stable reference
  whose supply growth tracks civilization-scale productivity.</p>
  <p>That reframing raised a natural follow-up question:<br />
  If fiat currencies drift structurally over time, do they also
  <em>fail</em> in a repeatable way?</p>
  <p>To explore this, we examined historical monetary regimes and asked
  a simple, consistent question:<br />
  Once a fiat system is no longer strictly backed by, or linked to,
  gold—how long does it remain viable?</p>
  <p>By focusing only on the lifespan of unanchored fiat regimes, and
  not on policy details or political narratives, we isolate the <em>time
  structure</em> of fiat decay.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language
  Summary)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>We define failure in practical terms: hyperinflation,
  redenomination, or replacement. All three reflect the same underlying
  event—loss of confidence in the unit as a reliable measure of
  value.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>We assemble 21 well-documented fiat episodes spanning roughly eight
  centuries and measure how long each system survived after becoming
  unanchored. The results are simple but striking:<br />
  the average lifespan is about <strong>31 years</strong>, with a median
  of about <strong>24 years</strong>. Many systems fail within roughly a
  generation; a smaller number persist much longer.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>When we fit these outcomes to a basic survival model, we find an
  exponential pattern:<br />
  S(t) ≈ exp(−t/τ), with τ ≈ 31 years.<br />
  This implies that by year ~31, an unanchored fiat system has about a
  63% probability of failure—a functional monetary half-life.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p>This pattern appears across regions, eras, and political systems.
  The paper does not claim specific policy causes. It documents a
  recurring statistical regularity and leaves causation open.</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>3) What Distinguishes This Framework From Existing
  Approaches</strong></p>
  <p>Most discussions of fiat collapse focus on specific stories: wars,
  bad leadership, corruption, or poor policy choices. While often true
  in detail, those explanations vary widely from case to case.</p>
  <p>Our approach strips all of that away. We ignore ideology,
  institutions, and policy design, and look only at two variables:</p>
  <p><strong>time since unbacking</strong>, and <strong>whether the
  currency survived</strong>.</p>
  <p>Viewed through this lens, a common pattern emerges: a
  generational-scale decay constant—about 31 years—that repeats across
  very different monetary regimes.</p>
  <p>Rather than trying to predict failure using country-specific
  drivers, we identify a systems-level regularity. Confidence in
  unanchored fiat appears to erode gradually and probabilistically, much
  like a relaxation process bounded by human memory and time
  preference.</p>
  <p>This also complements the gold paper. If gold provides a
  <em>measurement lens</em> that reveals fiat drift, this paper provides
  a <em>temporal lens</em> that describes how long unanchored fiat
  systems tend to remain viable. Together, they describe the same
  phenomenon from two different angles.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>4) Theoretical Implications (Assuming the Work Is
  Correct)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>A time constraint on fiat:</strong> Unanchored fiat systems
  appear to share a generational decay timescale, suggesting that
  confidence erosion operates independently of specific policies or
  regimes.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Confidence as a gradual process:</strong> The exponential
  survival curve implies many small, distributed decisions over time—not
  a single catastrophic mistake. Fiat failure looks less like an
  accident and more like a slow loss of collective trust.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Two-axis monetary analysis:</strong> Combined with the gold
  framework, monetary systems can be analyzed along two independent
  dimensions:<br />
  a measurement axis (drift versus alignment, via gold ratios),
  and<br />
  a time axis (how far the system has progressed along its decay
  curve).</p>
  </div></li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Generational Horizons and the ~31 Year Decay
  Constant</strong></p>
  <p>The estimated decay constant of roughly 31 years closely matches a
  familiar generational boundary. Across the dataset, most unanchored
  fiat regimes fail within a span corresponding to about one to two
  human generations.</p>
  <p>The model does not claim a causal mechanism, but the alignment is
  suggestive. Monetary stability depends on restraint, credibility, and
  shared memory of past failures. As generations turn over, the lived
  experience that once enforced discipline fades.</p>
  <p>After one generation, the reasons for caution weaken. After two,
  they are often forgotten entirely. This provides a plausible
  interpretation for why fiat systems show a repeatable half-life rather
  than a random pattern of collapse.</p>
  <p>In this sense, the ~31-year timescale may reflect not just a
  statistical regularity, but a deeper social rhythm: the lifespan of
  collective economic memory in systems where trust must be continuously
  renewed.</p>
  <p><strong>5) Potential Implications (Downstream, Not
  Predictions)</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Monitoring, not mandates:</strong> Institutions could track
  where a currency sits on the survival curve alongside gold-based drift
  measures, improving situational awareness without prescribing regime
  changes.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Scenario design and stress testing:</strong> Risk teams can
  include time-since-unbacking as a base-rate input when designing
  long-horizon scenarios. This remains descriptive, not
  deterministic.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Model hygiene:</strong> Macro and AI models can include a
  temporal stability feature (years unanchored) to reduce misattribution
  of late-cycle regime behavior to short-term shocks, complementing
  invariant features from the gold framework.</p>
  </div></li>
  <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
  <p><strong>Clearer historical teaching:</strong> Monetary history can
  be taught using base rates and time horizons rather than anecdotal
  collapse stories, pairing temporal decay with measurement drift for a
  more systematic view.</p>
  </div></li>
