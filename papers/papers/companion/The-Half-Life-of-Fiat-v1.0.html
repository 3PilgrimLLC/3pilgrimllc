	<hr />
      <p><strong>1) Why This Paper Exists (Linked to the Gold
      Paper)</strong></p>
      <p>In our prior work, we argued that gold is better understood as
      a stable measurement reference than as a speculative asset. Large
      moves in the “price of gold” mostly reflect changes in the
      currency used to measure it—that is, fiat drift relative to a
      slow, stable reference whose supply growth tracks
      civilization-scale productivity.</p>
      <p>That reframing raised a natural follow-up question:<br />
      If fiat currencies drift structurally over time, do they also
      <em>fail</em> in a repeatable way?</p>
      <p>To explore this, we examined historical monetary regimes and
      asked a simple, consistent question:<br />
      Once a fiat system is no longer strictly backed by, or linked to,
      gold—how long does it remain viable?</p>
      <p>By focusing only on the lifespan of unanchored fiat regimes,
      and not on policy details or political narratives, we isolate the
      <em>time structure</em> of fiat decay.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>2) What the Paper Says (Plain Language
      Summary)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>We define failure in practical terms: hyperinflation,
      redenomination, or replacement. All three reflect the same
      underlying event—loss of confidence in the unit as a reliable
      measure of value.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>We assemble 21 well-documented fiat episodes spanning roughly
      eight centuries and measure how long each system survived after
      becoming unanchored. The results are simple but striking:<br />
      the average lifespan is about <strong>31 years</strong>, with a
      median of about <strong>24 years</strong>. Many systems fail
      within roughly a generation; a smaller number persist much
      longer.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>When we fit these outcomes to a basic survival model, we find
      an exponential pattern:<br />
      S(t) ≈ exp(−t/τ), with τ ≈ 31 years.<br />
      This implies that by year ~31, an unanchored fiat system has about
      a 63% probability of failure—a functional monetary half-life.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p>This pattern appears across regions, eras, and political
      systems. The paper does not claim specific policy causes. It
      documents a recurring statistical regularity and leaves causation
      open.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>3) What Distinguishes This Framework From Existing
      Approaches</strong></p>
      <p>Most discussions of fiat collapse focus on specific stories:
      wars, bad leadership, corruption, or poor policy choices. While
      often true in detail, those explanations vary widely from case to
      case.</p>
      <p>Our approach strips all of that away. We ignore ideology,
      institutions, and policy design, and look only at two
      variables:</p>
      <p><strong>time since unbacking</strong>, and <strong>whether the
      currency survived</strong>.</p>
      <p>Viewed through this lens, a common pattern emerges: a
      generational-scale decay constant—about 31 years—that repeats
      across very different monetary regimes.</p>
      <p>Rather than trying to predict failure using country-specific
      drivers, we identify a systems-level regularity. Confidence in
      unanchored fiat appears to erode gradually and probabilistically,
      much like a relaxation process bounded by human memory and time
      preference.</p>
      <p>This also complements the gold paper. If gold provides a
      <em>measurement lens</em> that reveals fiat drift, this paper
      provides a <em>temporal lens</em> that describes how long
      unanchored fiat systems tend to remain viable. Together, they
      describe the same phenomenon from two different angles.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>4) Theoretical Implications (Assuming the Work Is
      Correct)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>A time constraint on fiat:</strong> Unanchored fiat
      systems appear to share a generational decay timescale, suggesting
      that confidence erosion operates independently of specific
      policies or regimes.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Confidence as a gradual process:</strong> The
      exponential survival curve implies many small, distributed
      decisions over time—not a single catastrophic mistake. Fiat
      failure looks less like an accident and more like a slow loss of
      collective trust.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Two-axis monetary analysis:</strong> Combined with the
      gold framework, monetary systems can be analyzed along two
      independent dimensions:<br />
      a measurement axis (drift versus alignment, via gold ratios),
      and<br />
      a time axis (how far the system has progressed along its decay
      curve).</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p><strong>Generational Horizons and the ~31 Year Decay
      Constant</strong></p>
      <p>The estimated decay constant of roughly 31 years closely
      matches a familiar generational boundary. Across the dataset, most
      unanchored fiat regimes fail within a span corresponding to about
      one to two human generations.</p>
      <p>The model does not claim a causal mechanism, but the alignment
      is suggestive. Monetary stability depends on restraint,
      credibility, and shared memory of past failures. As generations
      turn over, the lived experience that once enforced discipline
      fades.</p>
      <p>After one generation, the reasons for caution weaken. After
      two, they are often forgotten entirely. This provides a plausible
      interpretation for why fiat systems show a repeatable half-life
      rather than a random pattern of collapse.</p>
      <p>In this sense, the ~31-year timescale may reflect not just a
      statistical regularity, but a deeper social rhythm: the lifespan
      of collective economic memory in systems where trust must be
      continuously renewed.</p>
      <p><strong>5) Potential Implications (Downstream, Not
      Predictions)</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Monitoring, not mandates:</strong> Institutions could
      track where a currency sits on the survival curve alongside
      gold-based drift measures, improving situational awareness without
      prescribing regime changes.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Scenario design and stress testing:</strong> Risk teams
      can include time-since-unbacking as a base-rate input when
      designing long-horizon scenarios. This remains descriptive, not
      deterministic.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Model hygiene:</strong> Macro and AI models can include
      a temporal stability feature (years unanchored) to reduce
      misattribution of late-cycle regime behavior to short-term shocks,
      complementing invariant features from the gold framework.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
      <p><strong>Clearer historical teaching:</strong> Monetary history
      can be taught using base rates and time horizons rather than
      anecdotal collapse stories, pairing temporal decay with
      measurement drift for a more systematic view.</p>
      </div></li>
      </ul>
