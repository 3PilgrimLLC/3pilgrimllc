# Core Primitives Glossary

Curated glossary of foundational conceptual tools **coined or fundamentally reframed** by 3 Pilgrim LLC. These are minimal, reusable building blocks for modeling, analysis, and inference across domains.

This list is highly selective — only primitives central to the research framework are included.

- **Cognitive Mode Selection**  
  Operational fork between Emotional Reasoning Mode (ERM) and Logical Reasoning Mode (LRM); high-stakes stability depends on correct activation.  
  [Full paper](/papers/relationship-compatibility-v2.1.pdf)

- **Constraint Topology**  
  Structural mapping of fixed and elastic constraints shaping individual trajectories; compatibility requires non-overlapping rigidity.  
  [Full paper](/papers/relationship-compatibility-v2.1.pdf)

- **Degeneracy Amplification**  
  Role of overparameterization in creating multiplicity of near-equivalent solutions, later resolved by erosion.  
  [Full paper](/papers/fractal-hyperbolic-degeneracy.pdf)

- **Frustration Metric**  
  Topological measure of constraints preventing optimal configurations in high-dimensional systems.  
  [Full paper](/papers/configuration-frustration.pdf)

- **Gradient Erosion**  
  Training dynamics that carve negative space by selectively removing redundant parameter directions, revealing a resistant low-dimensional core.  
  [Full paper](/papers/fractal-hyperbolic-degeneracy.pdf)

- **Negative Tomography**  
  Universal inference framework treating structural failure modes as first-class primitives. Reconstructs latent structures via exhaustive characterization of impossibilities.  
  [Full paper](/papers/negative-tomography.pdf)

- **Parametric Friction Field**  
  Interpretation of the Fisher information metric as local friction on the parameter manifold (high in constrained directions, low in degenerate ones).  
  [Full paper](/papers/fractal-hyperbolic-degeneracy.pdf)

- **Parsimony-Leverage-Risk (PLR) Model**  
  Ternary gradient system for modeling behavioral tendencies under uncertainty (Parsimony, Leverage, Risk).  
  [Full paper](/papers/relationship-compatibility-v2.1.pdf)

- **Semiotic Conflation**
  Confusion in machine learning discourse where "dimensionality" is misused to refer to vector or parameter count rather than true independent axes, leading to paradoxes in scaling discussions.
  [Full paper](/papers/semiotic-frustration-in-machine-learning.html)

- **vnode (Vector-Node)**
Minimal, irreducible directional unit in parameter or activation space; the primitive element subject to aggregation in overparameterized regimes. Multiple near-equivalent vnodes form the substrate for illusory dimensionality growth.
  [Full paper](/papers/semiotic-frustration-in-machine-learning.html)


- **Vector Aggregation**
  Reductionist primitive representing the aggregation of vnodes (vector-nodes) — redundant, near-collinear or statistically dependent vector directions — into higher-density representations without adding new independent axes. Explains apparent (but illusory) increases in effective dimensionality in overparameterized models, in contrast to true structural growth. Serves as a key tool for resolving semiotic conflation paradoxes in scaling discourse.
